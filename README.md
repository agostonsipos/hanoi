Towers of Hanoi simulation.

Was an examination task for undergraduate students in 2015.

Folder *01 is the OpenGL application's source, folder *02 is the creation of the 3D models in OpenSceneGraph. Both are Visual Studio 2013 projects.
The projects need the ELTE Graphics pack for compiling (http://cg.elte.hu/~bsc_cg/resources/OGLPack.zip and http://cg.elte.hu/~bsc_cg/resources/OSGPack.zip respectively), and running the command `subst t: .` on Windows from the directory containing the O??Pack directory.
